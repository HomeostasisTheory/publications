# Summary #

Phenomenal consciousness is not neurological, not metaphysical, not informational, and not everywhere. It is physiological and psychological and is rooted in a phenomenon called Homeostasis. Living organisms are a hierarchy of homeostatic systems and the most fundamental homeostatic systems are found at the sub-cellular levels. Such systems can both be fully explained in terms of their electro-mechano-chemical characteristics and processes, yet also exhibit a drive that maintains one or more homeostatic variables.

# Motivation #

The inner membrane of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells maintain proton gradient under suitable conditions. This system has protein complexes embedded in the bi-lipid membrane that allow unidirectional transfer of protons. A proton concentration difference is maintained across the membrane. The resulting osmotic pressure (the proton-motive force) causes protons to move through the ATP synthase complex, allowing it to produce ATP that is the energy currency of cellular metabolism. As protons flow through the ATP synthase, eventually the proton concentration on both sides of the membrane would equalize, the osmotic pressure would vanish and ATP synthase would stop working. In order to prevent such as fate, there are various active channels embedded in the membrane that move (“pump”) protons back to the other side, against any osmotic pressure. These proton pumps (specifically, “electron transport chain”) work as long as energy in the form of ATP is available. The relative numbers of the ATP synthase and proton pumps and their behavioral dynamics maintain a specific proton gradient across the membrane. If proton gradient deviates from the steady state value, the system restores steady state using the differential operations of the two one-way mechanisms. This is a simplified description of this homeostatic system that would suffice our purposes here. For more details, refer to \[?\].

This was a mechanistic view of the system. The same system can be interpreted systemically as having a drive, a tendency or an agency to maintain and defend the specific proton gradient strength against deviations as long as favorable conditions are present. An important point to note is that this agency is not external - it is fully embodied in the system and can be fully explained (away) using a mechanistic description.

These two viewpoints are at the core of the apparent body-consciousness duality. To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between body and consciousness, one must fully appreciate the fact that these two viewpoints indeed describe the same system. Given the complexities and near impossibility of describing whole organisms from first principles, we start from the most fundamental homeostatic systems such as the proton gradient system.

We claim that only homeostatic systems have embodied agency. It is true that non-homeostatic systems perform work, but there is a critical difference. Non-homeostatic systems progress towards thermodynamic equilibrium, which is the lowest possible energy state. Essentially, such systems move where the environment takes them. On the other hand, homeostatic systems move towards a steady state, irrespective of the environment. A homeostatic steady state is a high-energy dynamic equilibrium state and the system consumes energy to move towards it. In the absence of an appropriate energy source, homeostatic systems do end up at thermodynamic equilibrium, which is a different state compared to the homeostatic steady state. An anthropomorphic analogy for steady state and thermodynamic equilibrium state would be alive and dead, respectively. The analogy is appropriate given that an alive organism maintains homeostasis while death indeed leads to thermodynamic equilibrium with the environment.

As soon as we ascribe (embodied) agency to homeostatic systems, the question of free will comes up, i.e. whether the system itself has the ability to modulate its own agency. The homeostatic systems that we do understand in great detail are homeostatic by the virtue of following the laws of physics, without any explicit intentionality. Such a system, for example, cannot proclaim that it would cease to maintain homeostasis. Their physiology itself fully embodies the direction and magnitude of the agency. Indeed, these are machines with agency that lack any free will (this description comes very close to what philosophical zombies are, more on that below).

We discussed two principles of mechanistically understandable homeostatic systems --- the embodied agency and their lack of free will. These two principles will serve as the bedrock upon which we will build the Homeostatic Theory of Consciousness.

# Homeostasis #

Before we move on, we would like to clarify our definition of ‘Homeostasis’ because there are wide ranging interpretations of that term. In the late 19^th^ century, Claude Bernard asserted that complex organisms are able to maintain their internal environment fairly constant in the face of challenges from the environment \\cite\{Cooper2008\}. A few decades later, Cannon formalized that concept as “Homeostasis” \\cite\{Cannon1929\}, describing it as the physiological mechanisms that maintain relatively constant the variables related to the internal milieu of the organism. Till that point, there were no specific restrictions on the mechanisms that Homeostasis could use. We use “Homeostasis” in this original mechanism-agnostic interpretation. When Curt Richter introduced behavioral control into the concept of homeostasis, he considered only the mechanism of negative feedback \\cite\{Woods2007\} and that became embedded in the interpretation of the term. Further research  found that such restricted conceptualizations of homeostasis lacked the necessary explanatory power to account for the variety of homeostatic-relevant phenomena. As a consequence, many contemporary investigators modified the concept to make it more inclusive of the data, providing terms such as predictive homeostasis \\cite\{Moore-Ede1986\}, reactive homeostasis \\cite\{Moore-Ede1986\}, homeorheusis \\cite\{Nicolaidis2011\}, homeorhesis \\cite\{Waddington1968\}, homeokinetics \\cite\{Soodak1978\}, rheostasis \\cite\{Mrosovsky1990\}, homeodynamic regulation \\cite\{Yates1982\}, heterodynamic regulation, heterostasis, allostasis \\cite\{Sterling2015\}, and allodynamic regulation \\cite\{Berntson2000\}. We divorce the types of mechanisms from the concept of homeostasis, and our definition covers these and other variants.

We use the term “homeostatic variable” (or “hvar” as abbreviation) to indicate any quantity that a homeostatic system defends. Although usually the hvar values are defended from both sides, i.e. a value is restored if it is too low or too high, the target (or set point or steady state) value can also be set to the minimum or maximum value, and such hvars behave as if their values are maintained only from one side.

Homeostatic steady state can mean either fixed target values for hvars or a specific dynamic behavior \\cite\{Waddington1968\} of hvar values. Dynamic behavior could be oscillatory, complex trajectories or even chaotic. This enables the concept of homeostasis to account for complex behaviors observed in biological systems.

# Embodied Agency #

Homeostatic systems demonstrate an agency that is directed towards homeostasis. This agency is -

* a result of the system’s physiology, particularly certain asymmetries and does not need any actor other than the system itself, and
* not under the system’s control; a homeostatic system has no choice but to proceed towards homeostasis

Embodied agency can be interpreted as a force (the “Homeostatic Force”) that pushes the systems towards homeostasis.

# What it feels like #

The homeostatic system “viscerally” feels the homeostatic force acting on itself along with the resulting movement of material and energy within it and across its boundaries. This embodied feeling is what it feels like to be that system. This is the basis for phenomenal consciousness.

Intensity of the embodied feeling is proportional to the magnitude of the homeostatic force vector. Specifically, when the system is far away from a steady state, that results in an intense feeling. On the other hand, at or near a steady state, the system feels calm.

# Experience #

Consider an event that moves a system to a new homeostatic state. The homeostatic force vector changes its direction and magnitude in response. An experience is what this transition of homeostatic force vector feels like. An experience feels positive (“good”), negative (“bad”) or neutral depending on whether the system moved towards, away from or kept its distance from a steady state.
